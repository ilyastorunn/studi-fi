# Lo-fi Background Image Placeholder

Please add your lo-fi.webp background image to this public directory.

The image should:
- Be named exactly "lo-fi.webp"
- Cover the full screen as background
- Be optimized for web (WebP format)
- Have a lo-fi aesthetic that matches your design

Current fallback: Gradient background will show if image is missing.
